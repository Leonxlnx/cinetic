// The sound events of the film, computed from the picture code. scripts/export-cues.ts calls the
// default export and writes out/cues.json; scripts/audio/score.py turns each event into a tuned
// sound on its exact frame (schema and recipes: references/sound.md).
//
// The rules this file follows:
// - One sound per visible event, and one visible event per sound.
// - Impacts go on the contact frame, pops on the 50% frame, settles on the 97% frame, and a
//   whoosh's apex on the velocity peak of the move it belongs to.
// - Import the constants the acts animate with (they export them for this file) and compute the
//   frame; a frame typed by hand drifts the first time an act is retimed.
